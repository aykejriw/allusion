## Contributing to Allusion

Allusion is an open source JavaScript bug tracking library. We really appreciate pull requests, bug reports and enhancement suggestions, here are our guidelines:

1. If filing a bug report, please verify the bug completely end-to-end. We encourage you to open up a [new issue](https://github.com/csmadhav/allusion/issues/new) with details.
Does the bug have to do with inlining styles, general module failures or installation issues? Those are also
possibly Allusion bugs and we will definetly look at them.
2. Working on an issue? File the bug at https://github.com/csmadhav/allusion/issues/new (if there
isnâ€™t one already). If your new change is going to be large it might be a good idea
to get the discussion started early. We are happy to discuss it beforehand.
3. Make sure that all the pull requests and bug reports provide justification for why they should be merged.
